  <h1>Sample Results for Commons-Math (Feb. 2016)</h1>
    <p>Compile and Tests, single-module project, 4 CPU laptop, as measured by GNU time. The value shown is the real (wall clock) time spend on the process.</p>

  <h2>Clean build from scratch</h2>

<p>
Sbt is quickest, by using all CPUs to the fullest (making the system unusable during that time).
The only major change since 2016 here is that the pants buildsystem took singificantly longer than in the previously benchmarked version.

  <h2>Rebuild without changes</h2>

</div>

<p>Several buildsystems recognize there is nothing to do, surprisingly pants is not among them.
A change since 2016 is that bazel now took considerable time to run again. The log shows a warning that the running server needs to be killed due to a change of start params (which did not change) so this might be a minor bug not affecting most users.
<p>

  <h2>Rebuild with change</h2>

<p>For this case I added a small no-op change to one source file.</p>

<div id="chart3" class='with-3d-shadow with-transitions chart'>

</div>

<p>This benchmark shows some buidsystems stop doing anything when rebuilding with a change, possibly because the change detection algorithms did not detect the change...<p>

    <h2>Rebuild first version</h2>

<p>For this case I manually reverted the file to the state of the first build.</p>
